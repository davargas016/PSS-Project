# PSS-Project
A Personal Scheduling System (PSS) Project that allows users to create tasks and place them in a schedule.  There are three different task types - Recurring, Transient, and Anti - that you can create and the tasks and their information can be printed out into a .csv file.  All tasks made have a user input name, a start time, duration, and a date.  This project focuses on object oriented programming, especially on the task types and how they are made and function.

This was a group project and I created the views and some of the task controller.
